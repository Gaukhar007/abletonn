    <h4> Making music isn’t easy. It takes time, effort, and <br> learning. But when you’re in the flow, it’s<br> incredibly rewarding.</h4><br>
 
      <p>We feel the same way about making Ableton products. The driving force behind<br> Ableton is our passion for what we make, and the people we make it for.</p></div>

        <h4>We are more than 350 people from 30 different<br> countries divided between our headquarters in <br>Berlin and our offices in Los Angeles and Tokyo. </h4><br>
     
          <p> Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of us use Live <br>and Push every day. We come from a wide range of cultural and professional<br> backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs, some are self-taught, and most of us are <br> somewhere in between. What connects us is the shared belief that each of us<br> has the skills and knowledge to contribute to something big: helping to shape<br> the future of music culture.  </p></div>

        <h4> We believe it takes focus to create truly <br>outstanding instruments. We only work on a few<br> products and we strive to make them great.  </h4><br>
     
          <p>  Rather than having a one-size-fits-all process, we try to give our people what<br> they need to work their magic and grow. We’ve learned that achieving the best <br>results comes from building teams that are richly diverse, and thus able to <br>explore problems from a wider set of perspectives. We don’t always agree with<br> each other, but opinion and debate are valued and openly encouraged.

        <h4> We’re passionate about what we do, but we’re<br> equally passionate about improving who we are. </h4><br>
     
          <p> We work hard to foster an environment where people can grow both personally <br>and professionally, and we strive to create a wealth of opportunities to learn<br>from and with each other.<br>

            Alongside an internal training program, employees are actively supported in <br>acquiring new knowledge and skills, and coached on applying these in their<br> daily work. In addition, staff-organized development and music salons are a <br>chance to discuss new technologies, production techniques and best practices.

            If you're joining us in Berlin, we'll help with relocation and paperwork. We’ll even<br> provide you with free German or English lessons. Plus, working in Germany<br> means you can expect comprehensive health insurance for you and your family, <br>as well as generous maternity and paternity leave. Office hours are flexible, but <br>it’s not all work; we have several company and team outings throughout the year<br> as well as a variety of fun, informal small-group activities.
